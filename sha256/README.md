- SHA-256 hash function reference implementation.

> This is an annotated direct implementation of FIPS 180-4, without any optimisations. It is intended to aid understanding of the algorithm rather than for production use.

> While it could be used where performance is not critical, I would recommend using the ‘Web Cryptography API’ (developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/digest) for the browser, or the ‘crypto’ library (nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_class_hash) in Node.js.
